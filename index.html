  <h1>Privacy Policy for TideWatcher</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: July 10, 2025</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to TideWatcher. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your data when you use our app.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>Location Data</h3>
  <p>We request “When In Use” location access solely to center the map on your current position and show nearby tide stations. Location data is used in-app and not stored on our servers.</p>
  <h3>Tide & Station Data</h3>
  <p>We fetch station lists and tide predictions from the NOAA Tides & Currents API. This data is cached temporarily in-app for performance.</p>
  <h3>Favorites</h3>
  <p>We store your favorite station IDs locally in your device’s UserDefaults so they persist across launches. We do not share or sell this data.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To display your current location on the map.</li>
    <li>To fetch and render tide predictions and charts.</li>
    <li>To save and load your favorites locally.</li>
    <li>Optionally, to collect anonymous analytics and crash reports if you opt in.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing & Security</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information. All API calls use HTTPS. Favorites and cached data remain on your device. We may disclose data to comply with legal obligations.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You can revoke location access in iOS Settings → Privacy → Location Services → TideWatcher. Clearing app data will remove your favorites. Uninstalling removes all locally stored data.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>TideWatcher is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from them.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect changes. Continued app use constitutes acceptance.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>For questions, email: <a href="mailto:support@tidewatchapp.com">support@tidewatchapp.com</a>.</p>
